No. By default, Android expects 3D assets like `.gltf` or `.glb` files to be stored in the **`assets`** folder rather than `res`. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Create an `assets` Folder**  
   In Android Studio, right-click on `app/src/main` and select **New** > **Folder** > **Assets Folder**. This will create a new folder named `assets` under `app/src/main`.

2. **Place Your 3D Model**  
   Inside the new `assets` folder, create a subdirectory (e.g., `hover_bike`) and put your model files there:
   ```
   app/
     src/
       main/
         assets/
           hover_bike/
             scene.gltf
   ```

3. **Access the Model in Code**  
   When you load the model via the XR session API, specify the path relative to `assets`:
   ```kotlin
   val gltfModel = xrSession.createGltfResourceAsync("hover_bike/scene.gltf").await()
   ```
   This call will look for `scene.gltf` inside the `hover_bike` subfolder in `assets`.

### Why Not Use the `res` Folder?

- **`res/` Folder:**  
  Reserved for Android’s resource system (e.g., layouts, drawables, strings). Files in `res` must follow specific naming and usage rules, and they’re accessed via resource IDs, not direct file paths.

- **`assets/` Folder:**  
  A better place for arbitrary files—like 3D models, fonts, or other data—where you want to load them as raw streams. The Android build system packages everything in `assets` without changing file names or applying resource naming restrictions.

By placing `.gltf` or `.glb` files in `assets`, you can freely structure your 3D model directories and load them at runtime via standard APIs like `context.assets.open(...)` or Jetpack XR’s `createGltfResourceAsync(...)`.
